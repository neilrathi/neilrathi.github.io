hi! i’m a freshman at stanford broadly interested in computational cognition.

more specifically, i do modeling work on language processing & production in humans and machines, with the long(er) term goal of building better computational language models ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9r4-IukAAAAJ&hl=en)) ([cv](./assets/vitae.pdf)).

outside of research, i like music, the california coast, and [music about the california coast](https://open.spotify.com/track/27ytYULTu6QSZBhGaOKq9i?si=8180e48578264a2a). you also might just be here for my [notes](./notes.html).

### colophon\*

this website is on its like eighth iteration even though i have no real justification for that. it uses the jekyll [minimal](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) theme and github pages. it leaves much to be desired.
