# about

hi! i'm a freshman at stanford broadly interested in mathematical approaches to cognition.

more specifically, i do modeling work on language processing & production in humans and machines, with the long(er) term goal of building better computational language models ([google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9r4-IukAAAAJ&hl=en)).

you can find some form of a CV [here](./assets/vitae.pdf) if you're into that.

outside of research, i do a lot, but i assume that's not why you're here. ask me about my spotify stats! or anything in general i really do just like talking.

you also might just be here for my [notes](./notes.html).

### colophon\*

this website is on it's like eighth iteration even though i have no real justification for that. it uses jekyll, github pages, and noto sans. it leaves much to be desired.
